High-Impact Topics & Problems
Below are the top 5 topics, simplified explanations, and the most representative problems (with LeetCode numbers). These are "must-knows" because they’re common, teach core skills, and overlap with other problems.
1. Arrays & Hashing (30% Coverage)
Why: Arrays are the backbone of most problems; hashmaps make them fast.

Key Ideas: 
Use arrays to store and scan data.

Hashmaps for quick lookups (O(1) time).

Core Problems (5-6 problems):
Two Sum (1): Find two numbers adding to a target. Hashmap → O(n).
Pattern: Pair-finding.

Valid Anagram (242): Check if two strings are anagrams. Hashmap counts.
Pattern: Frequency counting.

Group Anagrams (49): Group words by their sorted letters. Hashmap of lists.
Pattern: Grouping.

Contains Duplicate (217): Check for repeats in an array. Hashset.
Pattern: Uniqueness.

Subarray Sum Equals K (560): Find subarrays summing to k. Prefix sums + hashmap.
Pattern: Cumulative sums.

Top K Frequent Elements (347): Find k most common numbers. Hashmap + heap (optional).
Pattern: Top-k selection.

Time: 2 days (6 hours total).

2. Trees (15% Coverage)
Why: Trees (especially binary trees) are everywhere in hierarchical data.

Key Ideas: 
Traversal (preorder, inorder, postorder).

Depth and path problems.

Binary Search Trees (BSTs) for sorted data.

Core Problems (4-5 problems):
Binary Tree Inorder Traversal (94): Left → Root → Right. Recursive or stack.
Pattern: Tree walking.

Maximum Depth of Binary Tree (104): Height from root to leaf. Recursion.
Pattern: Tree height.

Validate Binary Search Tree (98): Check if left < root < right. Recursion.
Pattern: BST properties.

Path Sum (112): Does a root-to-leaf path sum to a target? DFS.
Pattern: Path finding.

Invert Binary Tree (226): Swap left/right kids. Recursion.
Pattern: Tree modification (bonus).

Time: 1.5 days (4-5 hours).

3. Graphs (15% Coverage)
Why: Graphs model networks (e.g., social connections, dependencies).

Key Ideas: 
DFS (deep dive), BFS (level-by-level).

Detect cycles or order tasks.

Core Problems (4-5 problems):
Number of Islands (200): Count "land" patches in a grid. DFS.
Pattern: Connected components.

Course Schedule (207): Can you finish tasks with prerequisites? BFS/DFS.
Pattern: Cycle detection.

Clone Graph (133): Copy a network. DFS/BFS.
Pattern: Graph traversal.

Word Ladder (127): "hit" → "cog" via steps. BFS.
Pattern: Shortest path.

Course Schedule II (210): Order tasks. Topological sort.
Pattern: Dependency ordering.

Time: 1.5 days (4-5 hours).

4. Dynamic Programming (15% Coverage)
Why: DP solves optimization problems by breaking them into steps.

Key Ideas: 
Memoize or tabulate subproblems.

Build solutions incrementally.

Core Problems (5 problems):
Climbing Stairs (70): Ways to climb with 1 or 2 steps. 1D DP.
Pattern: Counting ways.

House Robber (198): Max loot without neighbors. 1D DP.
Pattern: Max value.

Unique Paths (62): Paths in a grid. 2D DP.
Pattern: Grid paths.

Coin Change (322): Fewest coins for an amount. Knapsack DP.
Pattern: Minimization.

Longest Increasing Subsequence (300): Longest growing sequence. DP.
Pattern: Subsequence.

Time: 2 days (6 hours).

5. Sliding Window/Two Pointers (10% Coverage)
Why: Efficiently scan arrays/strings for patterns.

Key Ideas: 
Slide a window or move pointers to find substrings/subarrays.

Core Problems (3-4 problems):
Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (3): "abcabcbb" → "abc". Sliding window.
Pattern: Unique substring.

Container With Most Water (11): Max water between lines. Two pointers.
Pattern: Max area.

Minimum Window Substring (76): Shortest substring with all chars. Sliding window.
Pattern: Minimum window.

3Sum (15): Find triplets summing to 0. Two pointers.
Pattern: Multi-pointer.

Time: 1 day (3 hours).

Total Problems: ~22-25
These cover ~80% of LeetCode patterns (arrays, trees, graphs, DP, sliding windows).

Mix of Easy (e.g., Two Sum), Medium (e.g., Number of Islands), and a few Hard (e.g., Minimum Window Substring) to stretch your skills.

Bonus: Top 10 Problems for 80% Coverage
If you’re really short on time (e.g., 1 week), master these 10:
Two Sum (1)  

Valid Anagram (242)  

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (3)  

Binary Tree Inorder Traversal (94)  

Maximum Depth of Binary Tree (104)  

Number of Islands (200)  

Course Schedule (207)  

Climbing Stairs (70)

Container With Most Water (11)

These hit all 5 topics and overlap with tons of other problems.
